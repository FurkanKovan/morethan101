## Briefly, About
In this notebook, we analyzed key features of the 'spaceship-titanic' dataset from the Kaggle competition. First the features are visualized and analyzed. Later by comparing various machine learning models, with the help of LazyPredict library, we saw that LGBM and RandomForest models are the most convenient. We picked the LGBM model to make our submission.

## Results
* **LGBM Accuracy:** %81.08
* **RandomForest Accuracy:** %74.0
* **Kaggle Competition Score:** 0.80453
